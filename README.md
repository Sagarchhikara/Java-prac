# ☕ Java Practice Playground 🚀

Welcome to my **Java Practice Playground** — a cozy little corner where I break, fix, and level-up my Java skills.  
Think of it as my digital dojo for code karate 🥋.

## ✨ What’s Inside

- 📝 Small programs & exercises  
- 🧩 Coding challenge solutions  
- 💡 Notes, tips & experiments  

Basically: if it smells like Java, it probably lives here.
